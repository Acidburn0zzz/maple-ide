maple-ide is a graphical programming environment for the Maple development
board developed by LeafLabs; 'ide' is a common acronym which stands for
"Integraded Development Environment". This software is a modified version of
the popular open source Arduino environment retargeted towards the ARM
Cortex-M3 microcontroller in the Maple; the regular arduino toolchain is only
targeted towards AVR microcontrollers. 

This IDE includes a full ARM compiler toolchain ("arm-none-eabi-gcc") and a low
level library for the STM32 Cortex-M3 plaform called libmaple. libmaple is 
developed seperately and can be used straight from the command line; it is
available at: http://github.com/leaflabs/libmaple


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This binary release archive is usually unzipped into a convenient location 
instead of being installed like a regular software package. The software will
persistent configuration files and project directories in the user's home
directory regardless of where the program lives.

This software requires a couple odds and ends on some operating systems:

    Linux: 
        java (something in the past few years, say 1.5+)
        dfu-util (for uploading over USB; part of the openmoko project)

    Mac OSX: 
        everything is included with maple-ide
        
    Windows: 
        everything is included with maple-ide

Disclaimer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We make no claims that we "preserve" any design or strategy behind arduino,
which is why this being released as a separate branch of arduino and not as a
patch. Arduino is clearly organized around compiling to AVR, and compiling to
ARM is a hack. In the future we hope that the arduino compilation and upload
infrastructure will be generalized so that boards like the Maple which require
a non-AVR compiler can be developed for in the regular IDE by installing a
plugin or library.
