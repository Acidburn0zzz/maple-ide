maple-ide is a graphical programming environment for the Maple development
board developed by LeafLabs. It is a modified version of the popular open
source Arduino environment targeted towards the ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller
in the Maple; the regular arduino toolchain is only targeted towards the Atmel
series of AVR microcontrollers. 

This IDE includes a full ARM compiler toolchain ("arm-none-eabi-gcc") and a low
level library for the STM32 Cortex-M3 plaform called libmaple. libmaple is 
developed seperately and can be used straight from the command line; it is
available at: http://github.com/leaflabs/libmaple

 
Disclaimer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We make no claims that we "preserve" any design or strategy behind arduino,
which is why this being released as a separate branch of arduino and not as a
patch. Arduino is clearly organized around compiling to AVR, and compiling to
ARM is a hack. In the future we hope that the arduino compilation and upload
infrastructure will be generalized so that boards like the Maple which require
a non-AVR compiler can be developed for in the regular IDE by installing a
plugin or library.
