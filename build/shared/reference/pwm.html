<h1>Maple Reference Documentation: PWM</h1>
<p>
Pulse Width Modulatiom is a basic technique to create repeated square waves
(digital high/low voltage transitions) of user defined length and duty cycle.
It can be used as a way to encode an "analog" signal on a single 
digital (high/low) line using the time between transitions ("pulse width") 
as the variable; this technique is commonly used to send servo position 
and motor speed commands. Another use is to use to the ratio of "high" and
"low" time to approximate a voltage output; this technique can be used to
dim an LED or even (with careful filtering) generate audio waveforms.

<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
The Maple has a large number of 16-bit PWM outputs, each connected to one of 4
timers. Some configuration, such as the clock rate or prescaling, must be
common to the entire timer. 
<p>
Note that unlike the Arduino, the Maple does not have PWM functionality on
pin D10; all other pins are <a href="compatability.html">compatible</a>. 

<table>
  <tr><th>Timer <th>PWM Headers
  <tr><td>1     <td>D6,D7,D8,D31,D32,D33,D34
  <tr><td>2     <td>D0,D1,D2,D3,D11,D12
  <tr><td>3     <td>D11,D12,D25,D27,D28
  <tr><td>4     <td>D5,D9,D14,D24
</table>

<p>
In it's simplest form the device is a single counter with two variables. The
counter starts at zero and the output starts at "high". The counter increments
every clock cycle until it reaches the first variable number, at which point
the output goes "low". The counter continues incrementing until it reaches the
second variable at which point the output goes "high" again and the counter
resets to zero. 

<p>
This simple functionality could be approximated in software by setting a GPIO
high or low, but the beauty of PWM is that the usercode simply has to configure
the device and set the two variables and the device will function on it's own;
no further microprocessor cycles will be consumed. 

<p>
The Maple has 16-bit PWM resolution, which means that the counter and variables
can go up to 65535, as opposed to 255 with 8-bit resolution. With a 72MHz 
clock rate, a PWM output would have maximum duty cycle of about one millisecond;
using a prescaler acts as a clock divider in front of the counter and can
increase this maximum duty cycle (eg, an 8x prescaler would result in around an
8ms maximum duty cycle). Note that the resolution is also effectively limited
by the duty variable set by the user. 

<p>
Here are some commonly used PWM configurations (note: double check our math!):

<table>
  <tr><th>Purpose<th>Period (ms)<th>High (ms)<th>Prescaler<th>Period<th>Value
  <tr><td>LED Throb
      <td>0.020ms
      <td>0 to 0.020ms
      <td>1 (none)
      <td>0 to 767
  <tr><td>Servo Control
      <td>20ms
      <td>1.25 (0deg) <br>1.50ms (90deg) <br>1.75 (180deg)
      <td>21 <br>21 <br>21
      <td>4096 <br>4915 <br>5734
</table>

<h2><a name="functions">Function Reference</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt><code>setMode(pin_num, PWM)</code>
  <dd>This command is usually called from <code>setup()</code> to tell the
  microcontroller that <code>pin_num</code> should be configured to PWM output.

  <dt><code>timer_init(port, prescaler)</code>
  <dd>Currently this low level libmaple function is the only way to change
  the prescaler for a timer. Find the appropriate timer for a given PWM 
  header using the table above, then set the prescaler. This function would
  normally be called once from <code>setup()</code>, but the time can be
  "reinitialized" with a new prescaler at any time. The default prescaler is
  1 (eg, no prescaling). 

  <dt><code>pwmWrite()</code>
  <dd>This command sets the first (lower) PWM variable. Usercode must manage
  the appropriate maximum accepted value (based on the configured duty) on it's
  own.
