<h2><a name="hardware">Hardware Problems</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="hw1">The status LED is throbing and I can't upload my
      program!</a> 
  <dd>The LED throbs when there has been a failed software assertion.  You can
  still reprogram by resetting the board and uploading during the short window
  when the bootloader waits for a program. To make this window longer (it can
  be hard to get the timing right), hit the reset and then tap the bootloader
  button (make sure you aren't holding the bootloader button when the reset
  button is released or it will enter serial bootloader mode; if you tap
  afterwards it will stay in the USB bootloader window indefinately).

  <dt><a name="hw2">My board is bricked! I can't upload via the bootloader no matter what!</a>
  <dd> Use the hardcoded serial stm32 serial bootloader to reflash the
  bootloader.  
  <dd>If it really is bricked and you think it's our fault contact us!

  <dt><a name="hw3">My 5v peripheral doesn't work! (I2C, SPI, USART, etc)</a>
  <dd>Yup, the Maple is a 3.3v board. You may need to use a level converter.
  See the <a href="./compatability.html">compatability</a>, <a
  href="./gpio.html">GPIO</a>, or other feature specific documentation for more
  information.
</dl>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation Problems</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="in1">I don't have root/administrator access!</a>
  <dd> There are probably hacks or work-arounds to getting programs uploaded
  without higher level system permissions. If you can access usb character
  devices (ACM or ttyUSB style) you should be able to communicate with the
  Maple and reprogram using an FTDI converter and the serial bootloader, but we
  haven' tried and don't have a guide written up. 

  <dt><a name="in2">[Linux] I don't use udev!</a>
  <dd>There is probably a simple way to get autoconfiguration working with
  devfs; in the meanwhile you could try running the entire IDE as root.  </dl>
</dl>

<h2><a name="ide">IDE Problems</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="ide">[Mac OSX] The "Board" and "Serial Port" menu items are missing!</a>
  <dd>Sometimes this happens if you try to compile or upload without having a
  board selected; the work-around is to restart the IDE. Mysterious!
</dl>

<h2><a name="compiler">Common Compiler Problems</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="compile1"><code>NullPointerException</code></a>
  <dd>A classic! Make sure you have selected a board from the pulldown menu.
  <dt><a name="compile2"><code>undefined reference to `setup()'</code></a>
  <dd>Your sketch/program either does not include a setup function or it is
  not found by the compiler. Your program must include both  
  <code>void setup()</code> and <code>void loop()</code> functions; they don't
  have to do anything, but they have to be there. You can start with an example
  program (such as Examples &gt; Stubs &gt; BareMinimum) to get the basic 
  structure. See also the <a href="/docs/maple-ide/language/">language docs</a>.
  <br>This is a common error when your entire sketch is blank.  
  <dt><a name="compile3"><code>error: 'Serial' was not declared in this scope</code></a>
  <dd>The classic Arduino has only one USART device and uses the unique name
  "Serial" to control it. Larger devices like the Arduino Mega and the Maple
  have multiple USARTS refered to as Serial1, Serial2, etc. You probably want
  Serial2 on the Maple; that's the one connected to pins D0 and D1. See also
  the <a href="/docs/maple/usart/">USART docs</a>.
</dl>

<h2><a name="upload">Common Upload Problems</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="up1">My program is too large!</a>
  <dd>First, make sure you're using the FLASH target instead of RAM; there is
  serveral times more FLASH memory available for user programs. 
  <dt><a name="up2"><code>No DFU capable USB device found</code>
  <dd>This probably means you don't have a Maple plugged in or powered on!
  <dt><a name="up3">I have multiple Maples installed; how do I know which one will get flashed?</a>
  <dd>Because the Maple IDE uses DFU to upload programs, you can't select a
  particular Maple from the Serial Port menu to upload to a particular board.
  There's no solution to this problem for now: you'll have to just plug in 
  the Maples one at a time. If this is a real problem let us know and we'll
  see if we can come up with a quick solution.
</dl>

<h2><a name="cli">Command Line Issues</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="cli1">My flash programs don't seem to stick; they behave like they are RAM!</a>
  <dd> Make sure you "<code>make clean</code>" when switching between FLASH and
  RAM targets; make isn't smart enough to rebuild everything that needs to be
  for the new target.
